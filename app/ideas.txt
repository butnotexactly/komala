abyssal - Today at 3:44 PM
why tea
why not :meguface~1:
bring that thristy :regional_indicator_b:oi some fresh :meguface~1:
i know
you could have an injured pokemon blocking the way and you can use a potion on it to heal it so it will move
a machamp that wants to have an arm wrestling match
Fallenjan - Today at 4:44 PM
^backpacking onto the machamp thing, you have to catch a certain Pokemon in order to pass the puzzle (since a human wouldn't be able to beat a machamp).
Not always obvious what the Pokemon is but it is relatively easy to catch to pass the puzzle.
there's been a few suggestions saying specific Pokemon, I was just generalizing the idea.
jacob - Today at 5:55 PM
@abyssal  @Fallenjan yeah i definitely dig that idea (generally speaking)



1850 = 5 * d + (1/5) * d
3750 non donor 7500 donor

.calc (3750 / 5) / 4000


5 per day, 5 per pull, 3750 sum dailies out of 5000, 400 per pull
5 * d + 5 * (3750 / 5) * d / 4000 = 1000
5 * d + 5 * (7000 / 5) * d / 4000 = 1000

3750 = 168.4 days
7000 = 148.15 days


5 * d + 5 * (3750 / 5) * d / 3000 = 1000
5 * d + 5 * (7000 / 5) * d / 3000 = 1000

3750 = 160 days
7000 = 136.36 days




CATCHING MECHANICS

.ex / .explore
.fish

+5 pokeballs per daily (3 if not on game server), added to collection
Hard Limit of *sucessfully* catching 5 (?) per day, regardless of rarity / balls thrown

same jacobs as khux but all pulls are baseline 4000 for 5 pokemon
5 to guilt, not 7, can transfer traits

2500 for 3

EVOLVE MECHANICS

gyarados requires golden magikarp in



ENEMY MECHANICS

____ used double team (another copy appears)

life steal
status inflict
leech seed at start
burmy cloak absorbs one hit
plusle / minun share damage?

Special Attacks/Effects of Enemies:


???: hyper beam type / hydro cannon
snorlax: recovers hp when dipped below half, sleep
burmy: cloak absorbs/negates one full hit of damage (even if not targeted?)
mimikyu: burmy effect?
[x] chansey/blissey: heals enemy party
[x] chatot: causes confusion
porygon/ditto: transforms to random party member (at start?)
[x]electabuzz/scyther/scizor: crits
[x] gloom/vileplume: poison / sleep / giga drain
[x] gyarados: dragon rage (decrease hp by half each time)
[x] bulbasaur/ivysaur: leech seed
[x] venusaur: solarbeam / giga drain
[x] komala: always asleep, restores hp each turn

abra - teleport
[x] voltorb/elecrode: self-destruct
bagon/shelgon could be rough skin maybe, where the attacker takes 1/5 of the damage dealt or whatever ratio seems more fair
in competetive battle, alolan vulpix/ninetales are used with snow warning and its signature move, aurora veil, which halves all damage to your team for like 5-8 turns i believe


still need:
recoil
offensive buffers (innate, on turn)
defensive buffers (innate, on turn)
other status inflict
evasiveness
slight hp over time replenish (bell)
