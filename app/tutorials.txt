You received a Lv. **5** Charmander and a Charmeleon[+] evolution badge!

Welcome to Komala! My name is Oak. In this world, people `.trade` with and `.battle` one another using Pokémon! There are a few differences, though!

1) All Pokémon you collect have **one** single type, like <> or <>. Some types are strong against others, like water on fire, which can be seen with `.types`

2) A Pokémon `.party` is made up of a team placed strategically on one of many `.decks`! Different decks offer boosts to certain types of Pokémon, so be sure to try them all!

3) Instead of fighting one at a time, a trainer's party will attack together during a full turn! The idea is to use Pokémon with special abilities to **buff** the powers of the Pokémon that attack after it. Synergy!

So, [NAME], are you ready to start your adventure? Type `.map` (`.x` for short) to open the overworld!

__

Under **Paths**, you can see different routes you can take, like `n` for north and `s` for south.

Under **Actions**, you can various things to interact with, like puzzles or people! There are a lot of secret actions and paths too, so they won't always be listed. When you're ready, come see me in my `lab`!

_Type the name of a path or action to execute it. In this case, type `lab`_

__

"Ah, [NAME]! There you are. My grandson should be arriving soon... and here he is now! Let's learn to battle! It'll be pretty simple since you both only have one Pokémon each."

I haven't said my goodbyes yet!


> Your **Charmander** has already been equipped to your strongest slot of your deck, so type `.party` to see it!
> Well done. There are many other `.decks` to choose from by typing `.deck <name>`,



Oh! <NAME>, you're leaving on a Pokémon adventure? Come see me after you talk to Oak! I have a present for you.
